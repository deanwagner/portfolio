This project was created for the [Personal Portfolio assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/advanced-html-and-css/lessons/personal-portfolio) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own concepts to make it more functional and user-friendly.

I created overall dark and light themes that autoload based on the user's browser/OS settings as well as the ability to change the accent color.
